# mask_refinement
Refining masks using [MGMatting](https://github.com/yucornetto/MGMatting) model. The goal of this project was to evaluate if the MGMatting model would be a viable option for refining masks. I was looking to see if the model would work for different types of images since it was trained primarily on two datasets. I evaluated the model that was trained on [real-world portraits](https://livejohnshopkins-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/qyu13_jh_edu/Edl8x0nQjy1JhGP6rcV0N-cB654HpmZZa5bwW9rYUvmsJg?e=J3lSba).
